# Project

## Metricly - A server monitoring tool that provides real-time data on the performance of your servers

### Current

- work around with vite
- adding ip's of server using nmap or manually having them entered in and stored in (file or database)
- convert docker metrics to human readable and display them neatly
- make sidebar with all added servers and then look into charts and stuff

### TODO

#### Documentation

- Write documentation

#### Frontend

- Sidebar with all added servers
- add server can be a popup where the background gets blurred
- Metrics displayed in real time and human readable
- Whole frontend (dashboard, etc.) (will try to use Material UI and React)
- Charts using mui
- notifications for when a server goes down

#### Backend

- Add more metrics
- Adding servers and getting their metrics over local network
- Full database stuff (sqlite3)
- Making Docker Compose file
- implement notifications
- adding ip's of local servers and having them display at the bottom of the sidebar

#### Miscellaneous

- Testing
- Update .env and requirements
- Figure out what to do with package.json and package-lock.json
- ~~Put all __pycache__ files in .gitignore~~
